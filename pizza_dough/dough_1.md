pizza dough
===========

* 4 1/2 cups (20.25 ounces) unbleached high-gluten, bread, or all-purpose flour, chilled 
* 1 3/4 (.44 ounce) teaspoons salt
* 1 teaspoon (.11 ounce) instant yeast 
* 1/4 cup (2 ounces) olive oil (optional)
* 1 3/4 cups (14 ounces) water, ice cold (40Â°F) 
* Semolina flour OR cornmeal for dusting

Stir together the flour, salt, and instant yeast in a bowl. With a large metal spoon, stir in the oil and the cold water until the flour is all absorbed.Reverse the circular motion a few times to develop the gluten further. Do this for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and the ingredients are evenly distributed. The dough should clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is too wet and doesn't come off the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in some more flour just until it clears the sides. If it clears the bottom of the bowl, dribble in a tea- spoon or two of cold water. The finished dough will be springy, elastic, and sticky, not just tacky, and register 50 to 55F.

Sprinkle flour on the counter and transfer the dough to the counter. Using a metal dough scraper, cut the dough into 3-6 equal pieces (depending on how large/small you want). Transfer dough balls to the sheet pan. (Optionally mist or rub with oil). Cover with a towl. Let rise for a while.
